# T3SF Examples
This folder contains examples of the frameowk in action on various platforms, including Discord, Slack, Telegram, and WhatsApp. The framework uses a modular structure that allows for easy customization and extension.

## Examples
Inside each platform folder, there are example scripts and screenshots that demonstrate how T3SF can be used. These examples are intended to help you get started with the framework and show how it can be customized and extended for your own projects.

## Other Files
In addition to the platform examples, this folder also includes an example Excel file and JSON file for the MSEL (Master Scenario Events List) project. These files are intended to demonstrate how T3SF can be used for the execution of a TTX.

## Getting Started
To get started with T3SF, you can start by exploring the examples provided in this folder. Each platform folder contains a `README.md` file that explains how to run the example scripts and use the framework on that platform.
